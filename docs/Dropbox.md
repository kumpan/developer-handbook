# How we organize files

## Client-based file organization

The way we sort files is based in the clients and typically looks like **The Client** → **Project Type** → **The Date** → **Project Instance**.

**The Client**:this is the name of the client we are billing. In some cases we do work for a client through, eg. Blocket, in this case the Dropbox structure could be **Blocket** → **Nordea** → **15/10/19** → **Delivery**

**Project Type**: for bigger clients things get crowded fast, so we sort orders into sub-categories, eg. print, tv, web etc. This isn't needed for every project, just the biggies.

**The Date**: the date the project was started. Please use YY-MM-DD as date format. This way the newest will always be at the bottom. If you're on mac, please don't use '/', poor windows users won't be able to see these folders.

**Project Instance**: for most projects there are more than one deliverable, this is how we separate them. Eg. Banner, web, TV and so on.

## Common folders

Inside each Project Instance, we will often find multiple folders. These folders are usually:

### \_assets

Assets for typically for backgrounds, images, icons etc.

### \_delivery

Delivery is intended for the final, proofed file for the client.

### \_material specification

Material Specification is intended for, well, you guessed it.

### \_misc

This is where most 'junk' end up. It could contain archived & old files as well as tests.

### \_proof

This is where we put files that are being/to be proofed by clients. In this folder we mark each round sent to a client, so we know which revision we're currently on.

## Things to consider

- **File things immediately**. If you wait to file things they’ll get out of hand. As soon as you create or receive a file, put it in its proper place.
- **Sort everything at the end of the project**. Look through the files you’ve worked on and make sure they’re in the right place. Tidy things up, delete any unnecessary files, and generally stop things getting messy before they get too bad. This makes it a lot easier for the next person to pick-up where you left.
- **Use descriptive names**. When you’re naming your files, give them descriptive names. “drzgzh”, "video" & "final" is bad. “Reklamfilm 1, Samla dina lån och krediter” is slightly better.
- **Don’t use too many folders**. Having too many nested folders gets annoying. If your project doesn't require some folders because there are too few files, skip 'em!
- **Stick with it**. Please don’t give up after a few days. It always takes a little time to adapt to something new. However, if you have some improvements in mind, share!
