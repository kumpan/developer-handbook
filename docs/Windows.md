## Tips

- Disable OneDrive as fast as possible. When it is running, it will try and sync your files to the cloud, which greatly interferes during testing with a code editor using active reload.

- Disable automatic installation of updates, as they can cause unwanted restarts of Windows. However, remember to install critical updates when you can/have time.
