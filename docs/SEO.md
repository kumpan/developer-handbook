# SEO
SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization and when it is implemented in a project it will make the site easier for search engines to find and index it.

Here are a few guidlines for SEO:

1. `<title></title>` tag is used by social networks, browser tabs and are displayed as the link to the site on SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages). They should be no more than 60 characters and you should put the most important keywords first. Brand names should come last.

2. `<meta>`tag description is often used to display info about the site below the it's link on SERPs. Keep the description to about 155 characters and **do not** use "". Search engines cuts off all text at the first ". This feature isn't always necessary and should be omitted if the client wants to go for low volume keywords.

3. `<img>`tag should always have descriptive alt-property! Besides the fact that all screen readers use it, search engines use it to index images properly. It should be limited to 120 characters because most of the popular screen readers cuts off at 125 characters.

4. `<a>`tag text should be descriptive, but avoid keyword bloating. Avoid general "click here" as far as you can and add `rel="no follow"` for paid links and untrusted content (user submitted links).

5. URLs should be human readable. Avoid using ids in the link. Use keywords that are descriptive of the hierarchy in stead, eg kumpan.com/clients/Blocket.
Try to avoid duble content.
   Watch out for duble content. Double content is when content can be accessed through more than one URL. Use 301 redirects or `rel="canonical"` to avoid this.
