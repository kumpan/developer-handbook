# KUMPAN Developer Handbook

A few ground rules:

- Install Prettier and have it run on save [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- Use prettier! Seriously it's awesome!
- We use english in git and on github
- Always ask for a code review from one of your colleagues
- Ask questions! If you get stuck on something one of your colleagues probably have had the same issue.
